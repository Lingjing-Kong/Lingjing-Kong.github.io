Hey there! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://csd.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
I'm extremely fortunate to have an incredible trio of advisors: [Yuejie Chi](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yuejiec/), [Eric P. Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/), and [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/).

Iâ€™m passionate about building machine learning models that are adaptive, controllable, and interpretable, all while leveraging principles from causality.

Feel free to email me if you'd like to connect!
